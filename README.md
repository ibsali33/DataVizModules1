# Data Visualization Modules
This repository aggregates modules I created for different types of data visualization strategies. It includes code for creating heatmaps using  `pheatmap` and various plots using the ggplot library. For the full breadth of ggplot data visualization options check out RStudio Cloud's Data Visualization with `ggplot` cheat sheets.

## Requirements
dplyr, RColorBrewer, pheatmap, tidyr, and tibble
